                <!-- Overview -->
                <h1 id='overviewLink'>Overview</h1>
                <p>CAST uses a series of visual representations to describe and generate expressive chart
                    animations.</p>

                <!-- Visual Encodings -->
                <h1 id='visEncodingLink'>Visual Representations</h1>
                <p>According to Canis grammar, animations of a chart are composed of a series of aniunits. Each aniunit
                    describes the animation of the selected marks by partitioning them into mark untis then bind each
                    mark unit with timing and animation effects. Thus marks in the same unit should animate together and
                    share the same animation properties(duration, delay, effect, easing)</p>

                <h2 id='kfLink'>Keyframe</h2>
                <p>Chart animations can be represented with a keyframe sequence. For each mark
                    unit, CAST selects the last frame of its animation as the keyframe. As shown in the following
                    example, the animation of the facet dot plots can be represented with a series of frames, and one
                    keyframe for each cell is extracted by CAST to describe this animation.</p>

                <div class='example'>
                    <div class='example-image'>
                        <img height='160px' src='./img/kf_illus.gif' />
                    </div>
                    <div class='example-text'>
                        <p><b>Chart</b>: Each dot represents one sample. All dots are grouped by Odor along X axis and
                            grouped by Surface along Y axis. Meanwhile Color encodes whether the sample is Edible.</p>
                        <p><b>Animation</b>: For all dots, animate row by row, and within each row, animate by cell.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                </div>

                <h2 id='kfGroupLink'>Keyframe Group</h2>
                <p>The animation is used to convey data patterns. Thus the mark unit is
                    created by gradually grouping all visual marks with data variables. And a hierarchical structure
                    will be generated from this grouping procedure. Taking the previous animation as an example, all the
                    dots are first grouped by Surface, then by Odor. CAST uses frames to represent this grouping
                    hierarchy, and the grey scale of the background color of the frame indicates the depth level of this
                    group. </p>

                </div>

                <h2 id='iconLink'>Symbolic Representation</h2>
                <p>CAST uses the following properties to describe the animation of each mark unit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Duration</b>: The duration time of the animation. Represented by a blue span with an arrow in
                        the center, the width of the span indicates the length of duration time.</li>
                    <li><b>Delay</b>: The delay time of the animation of this mark unit. Represneted by an orange span
                        with an arrow in the center, the width indicates the length of delay time. </li>
                    <li><b>Effect</b>: By which kind of effect this mark unit is animated. Each kind of effect has its
                        corresponding icon.</li>
                    <li><b>Easing</b>: What easing function this mark unit uses to animate. Each easing function has its
                        corresponding icon.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Note</b>: keyframes within the same group have the same animation properties, thus the effect and
                    easing are shown on group level.</p>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/icons.png' />
                </div>

                <h2 id='rTimingLink'>Relative Timing Representation</h2>
                <p>Having the visual representation for each mark unit (keyframe) is not enough to represent the
                    animation
                    of the whole chart. We still need to show the relative timing relationships between keyframes and
                    between keyframe groups. </p>

                <h3>Relative Timing Between Keyframes</h3>
                <p>Between two keyframes, there could be the following four kinds of relative timing relations: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Start with previous</b>: The second keyframe starts at the same time with the first one.</li>
                    <li><b>Start with previous + delay</b>: The second keyframe starts after the "delay" time when the
                        first one started. </li>
                    <li><b>Start after previous</b>: The second keyframe starts right after the first one ends.</li>
                    <li><b>Start after previous + delay</b>: The second keyframe starts after the "delay" time when the
                        first one ended.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/kf_relation.png' />
                </div>

                <h3>Relative Timing Between Keyframe Groups</h3>
                <p>Similar to keyframes, there are also four kinds of relative timing relations between keyframe groups:
                    start with previous, start with previous + delay, start after previous, and start after previous +
                    delay.</p>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/kfgroup_relation.png' />
                </div>

                <h3>Relative Timing Between Aniunits</h3>
                <p>Each aniunit decribes the animation of a series of selected marks. Thus it is represented as a
                    keyframe group as well. The previous example is to align two groups on group level (one group start
                    with/after another). However the relative timing relation between keyframe groups representing
                    aniunits have one more alignment type. Which is to align keyframes within those groups. In order to
                    meet the demand of animating the marks with different shapes but encoded with the same data (e.g.
                    line charts with nodes and labels). As shown in the following example, when one group start after
                    another group and they are aligned on keyframe level, there are two kinds of representations, when
                    they are separated, you can specify animation propeties for each group separatly while they share
                    the same animation properties when they are merged.</p>

                <p>The user interface of CAST consists of the following components: </p>

                <h1 id='authoringAnimationLink'>Authoring Animations</h1>
                <p>CAST uses the following four steps to author chart animations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Step 1 (Importing)</b>: Create chart with Charticulator, Vega, or D3, then
                        using our online or your own customized toolkit to generate the DSVG input.</li>
                    <li><b>Step 2 (Selecting)</b>: Select the smallest mark unit (marks in 1st keyframe) in animation.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 3 (Sequencing)</b>: Based on the selected mark unit and marks in the chart,
                        select the desired animation sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Step 4 (Animating)</b>: Specify timing (duration, delay) and other
                        animation properties (effect, easing) to each mark unit.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that step 2 to step 4 can be repeated to create multiple aniunits in order to specify different
                    animations to different marks. </p>

                <h2 id='importLink'>Importing</h2>
                <h3>Chart Preparation</h3>
                <p>We have an <a href='https://tgeconf.github.io/discussion/dsvg/index.html'>online DSVG generator</a>
                    which can generate DSVG with charts authored from the following tools: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charticulator (.chart/.tmplt): data file in csv format is also needed when using the templete

                <p>Mark selection is to decide which marks to animate first (which also decides the scale of the mark

                <p>As shown in the figure. There are three ways to select marks in CAST: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Selection Tool</b>: </li>
                    <ol>

                            inside the selection border are being selected. The marks unselected will be translucent
                            while the selected ones are shown inside a bounding box with blue borders on mouse up, and
                            the data records corresponding to the selected marks in the Dataset panel will also be
                            highlighted.</li>
                        <li>To select more, click or drag another rectangular selection on the unselected marks.</li>
                        <li>To deselect marks, click or drag rectangular selection on the selected marks.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li><b>Lasso Tool</b>: </li>

                            clicking on a non-sorted column, all data records will be sorted in asscending order
                            according to this data attribute; if the column is already sorted, then it will switch to
                            the opposite order (asscending to descending, descending to asscending).</li>
                        <li>Click on the row to select one data record. To select a range, select a row, then with the
                            left mouse button pressed, drag over to other rows. Or use "Shift + click" to select
                            non-adjacent rows. Meanwhile the corresponding marks in the chart will be selected.</li>
                        <li>To deselect marks, click or "click + drag over" on the selected rows.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>

                <h3>Suggestion Mode</h3>
                <p>As shown in the figure in Selection Tools, there is one more button in the toolbox of chart panel. It
                    is used to activate/deactivate the suggestion mode of the selection. When the suggestion mode is
                    activated, the system will automatically select marks from the unselected ones with the same values
                    of the same categorical attributes as those user-selected marks. Here is an example shown below:
                </p>
                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/suggestion.png' />
                </div>

                <h2 id='seqLink'>Sequencing</h2>
                <p>There are small plus buttons before keyframe groups who have marks that can be further partitioned
                    into smaller mark units in order to animate them in a more detailed animation sequence. Once the
                    marks are selected in the Chart Panel, drag the selected marks to the Keyframe Panel, and those plus
                    buttons before the keyframe groups who can be further partitioned with the selected marks as one
                    mark unit will be highlighted. Drop the selected marks on one plue button and you will start to
                    create new animation sequence of the marks of the corresponding keyframe group.</p>
                <p>An example is shown in the figure below.</p>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/kf_suggestion.png' />
                </div>

                <h2 id='animationLink'>Animating</h2>
                <p>This step is to bind animation properties to to each keyframe group and keyframe. Including timing
                    properties (duration and delay) and effect properties (effect type and easing)</p>

                <h3>Specifying Timing to Keyframes</h3>
                <p>Each keyframe has a duration bar indicating the duration of the animation of its corrsponding mark
                    unit. Drag the bar on the bottom of the keyframe to add/remove delay or adjust relative timing
                    (start with/after previous). Note that keyframes in the same group should share the same animation
                    property values. Thus to update one keyframe will update all keyframe within the same group.</p>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/bind_kf_timing.png' />
                </div>

                <p>Drag the right border of the delay/duration bar or enter the exact number in the popup when hovering
                    mouse on the delay/duration bar to adjust the length of the duration or delay.</p>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/adjust_timing.png' />
                </div>

                <h3>Specifying Timing to Keyframe Groups</h3>
                <p>The duration of each keyframe group is determined by the total duration of the keyframes within it.
                    Thus we can only specify delay and relative timing bewteen keyframe groups</p>

                <div class='single-col-img-container'>
                    <img src='./img/bind_kfg_timing.png' />
                </div>

                <h3>Specifying Effects to Keyframe Groups</h3>
                <p></p>
